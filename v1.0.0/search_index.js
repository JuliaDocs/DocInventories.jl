If it is a URL, the options timeout (seconds to wait for network connections), retries (number of times to retry) and wait_time (seconds longer to wait between each retry) may be given. The source must contain data in the given mime type. By default, the mime type is derived from the file extension, via auto_mime.\n\nThe Inventory acts as a collection of InventoryItems, representing all the objects, sections, or other linkable items in the online documentation of a project.\n\nAlternatively,\n\ninventory = Inventory(; project, version=\"\", root_url=\"\", items=[])\n\nwith a mandatory project argument instantiates an inventory with the InventoryItems in items. If items is not given, the resulting empty inventory can have InventoryItems added afterwards via push!.\n\nAttributes\n\nproject: The name of the project\nversion: The version of the project (e.g., \"1.0.0\")\nroot_url: The root URL to which the item.uri of any InventoryItem is relative. If not empty, should start with \"https://\" and end with a slash.\nsource: The URL or filename from which the inventory was loaded.\nsorted: A boolean to indicate whether the items are sorted by their name  attribute, allowing for efficient lookup. This is true for all inventories  loaded from a URL or file and false for manually instantiated inventories.\n\nNote that source and sorted are informational attributes only and are ignored when comparing two Inventory objects.\n\nItem access\n\nItems can be accessed via iteration (for item in inventory), by numeric index (inventory[1], inventory[2], … inventory[end]), or by lookup: inventory[name] or inventory[spec], where spec is a string of the form \":[domain:]role:`name`\", see the discussion of spec in InventoryItem. The lookup delegates to find_in_inventory with quiet=true and takes into account item.priority.\n\nSearch\n\nThe inventory can be searched by calling inventory(search; include_hidden_priority=true). This returns a list of all items that contain search in spec(item) or repr(item; context=(:full => true)). Typically, search would be a string or a Regex. Some examples for common searches:\n\nA spec of the form \":domain:role:`name`\", in full, partially, or as a regex.\nPart of a url of a page in the project's documentation, as a string\nThe title of a section as it appears somewhere in the project's documentation.\n\nThe search results are sorted by abs(item.priority). If include_hidden_priority=false, negative item.priority values are omitted.\n\nMethods\n\nfind_in_inventory(inventory, name) – find a single item in the inventory\nsave(filename, inventory; mime=auto_mime(filename)) – write the inventory to a file in any supported output format.\nshow_full(inventory) – show the unabbreviated inventory in the REPL (ideally via TerminalPager)\nuri(inventory, key) – obtain the full URI for an item from the inventory.\npush!(inventory, items...) – add InventoryItems to an existing inventory.\nappend!(inventory, collections...) – add collections of InventoryItems to an existing inventory.\ncollect(inventory) – convert the inventory to a standard Vector of InventoryItems.\nset_metadata(inventory) – Modify the project and version metadata.\nsort(inventory) – convert an unsorted inventory into a sorted one.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"api/#DocInventories.InventoryFormatError","page":"API","title":"DocInventories.InventoryFormatError","text":"An error indicating an issue with an inventory file.\n\nthrow(InventoryFormatError(msg))\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"api/#DocInventories.InventoryItem","page":"API","title":"DocInventories.InventoryItem","text":"An item inside an Inventory.\n\nitem = InventoryItem(; name, role, uri, priority=1, domain=\"jl\", dispname=\"-\")\n\nrepresents a linkable item inside a project documentation, referenced by name. The domain and role take their semantics from the Sphinx project, see Attributes for details on these parameters, as well as priority and dispname. The uri is relative to a project root, which should be the Inventory.root_url of the inventory containing the InventoryItem.\n\nFor convenience, an InventoryItem can also be instantiated from a mapping spec => uri, where spec=\":domain:role:`name`\" borrows from Sphinx' cross-referencing syntax:\n\nitem = InventoryItem(\n    \":domain:role:`name`\" => uri;\n    dispname=<name>,\n    priority=(<domain == \"std\" ? -1 : 1>)\n)\n\nThe domain is optional: if spec=\":role:`name`\", the domain is \"std\" for role=\"label\" or role=\"doc\", and \"jl\" otherwise.

The name will be a sluggified version of the title, making the item equivalent to item = InventoryItem(\":std:label:`name`\" => uri; dispname=title, priority=-1).\n\nAttributes\n\nname: The object name for referencing. For code objects, this should be the  fully qualified name. For section names, it may be a slugified  version of the section title. It must have non-zero length.\ndomain: The name of a Sphinx domain.  Should be \"jl\" for Julia code objects (default), \"py\" for Python code  objects, and \"std\" for text objects such as section names. Must have  non-zero length, and must not contain whitespace or a colon.\nrole: A domain-specific role (type). Must have nonzero length and not contain whitespace.\npriority: An integer flag for placement in search results. Used when searching in an Inventory, for item access in an Inventory, and with find_in_inventory. The following flag values are supported:\n1: the \"default\" priority. Used by default for all objects not in the \"std\" domain (that is, all \"code\" objects such as those in the \"jl\" domain).\n0: object is important\n2 (or higher): object is unimportant\n-1 (or lower): object is \"hidden\" (may be omitted from search). Used by default for all objects in the std domain (section titles)\nSee find_in_inventory for details. The above semantics match those used by Sphinx.\nuri: A URI for the location of the object's documentation, relative to the location of the inventory file containing the item. Must not contain whitespace. May end with \"$\" to indicate a placeholder for name (usually as \"#$\", for an HTML anchor matching name).\ndispname: A full plain text representation of the object. May be \"-\" if the display name is identical to name (which it should be for code objects). For section titles, this should be the plain text of the title, without formatting, but not slugified.\n\nMethods\n\nuri – Extract the full URI, resolving the $ placeholder and prepending a root_url, if applicable.\ndispname – Extract the dispname, resolving the \"-\" shorthand, if applicable.\nspec – Return the specification string \":domain:role:`name`\" associated with the item\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"api/#DocInventories.auto_mime-Tuple{Any}","page":"API","title":"DocInventories.auto_mime","text":"Determine the MIME type of the given file path or URL from the file extension.\n\nmime = auto_mime(source)\n\nreturns a MIME type from the extension of source.
